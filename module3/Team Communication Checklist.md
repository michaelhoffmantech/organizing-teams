- Are meeting expectations documented? Agendas, summaries, visual tools?
- Are AI tools being used effectively to support asynchronous communication?
- Are knowledge sharing practices in place? (Lunch & learns, WIKIs, developer portals)
- Are feedback mechanisms promoting psychological safety? (One-on-ones, retros, anonymous surveys)
- Is role-based communication defined (RACI or similar)?

## Cross-Team Communication
- Are team APIs documented and visible?
- Are interaction patterns clearly defined? (Collaboration, X-as-a-service, Facilitation)
