# Team Structure & Alignment Survey

This survey is intended to support team discovery, not performance evaluation. Responses should reflect current experience, not aspirational goals.

## Scale Definition (Explicit)

Use a 5-point Likert scale:
- Strongly disagree
- Disagree
- Neither agree nor disagree
- Agree
- Strongly agree

(You can optionally include “Not applicable,” but I’d recommend against it unless necessary.)

## Goal & Outcome Alignment

> If you hear feedback like, ‘I’m not sure how the work I’m doing impacts our customers…’

Questions: 

- I understand the goals our team is responsible for delivering.
- I understand how our team’s work contributes to organizational outcomes.
- Our team’s priorities are clear and consistent.
- Changes in priorities are communicated effectively.

## Skill Coverage & Dependency Risk

> Ask members if they feel the team has the proper skills to not rely on other teams.

Questions: 

- Our team has the skills required to deliver our work end-to-end.
- We rarely need to wait on other teams to complete our work.
- When we do rely on other teams, expectations and timelines are clear.
- Skill gaps are identified and addressed proactively.

## Roles & Responsibilities

> Ask members if they feel both are well defined and understood.

Questions: 

- My role and responsibilities are clearly defined.
- I understand the roles and responsibilities of other team members.
- Decision ownership is clear on our team.
- Role boundaries enable collaboration rather than restrict it.

## Autonomy & Decision-Making

> Ask members if they feel decision-making authority and autonomy are well defined and understood.

Questions: 

- Our team can make most day-to-day decisions without external approval.
- We have the authority to change how we work when needed.
- Escalation paths are clear when decisions exceed our authority.
- Our team is trusted to deliver outcomes, not just tasks.

## Communication & Collaboration

> Ask members if they feel communication expectations and collaboration patterns are well defined and understood.

Questions: 

- Communication within the team is effective.
- Communication with external teams is effective.
- Feedback is encouraged and acted upon.
- Meetings are purposeful and contribute to progress.

## Ownership & Accountability

> Ask members if they feel ownership and accountability for outcomes are well defined and understood.

Questions: 

- Our team feels ownership over the outcomes we deliver.
- Successes and failures are owned collectively.
- We understand how success is measured for our team.
- Metrics used to assess our work feel meaningful.

## Learning, Growth & Upskilling

> Ask members if they feel expectations for learning, growth, and skill development are well defined and understood.

Questions: 

- I have opportunities to learn skills outside my core specialization.
- The organization supports skill growth required by our team.
- Communities of practice or similar structures help me learn.
- I feel encouraged to step outside my comfort zone.

## Cognitive Load & Sustainability 

> Ask members if they feel expectations around workload, complexity, and sustainability are well defined and understood.

Questions: 

- I feel confident in my ability to complete my work effectively.
- My workload feels sustainable over time.
- The tools and platforms we use reduce unnecessary complexity.
- I have enough time to address quality and technical debt.

## Open-Ended, High Value Questions (Optional)

Use 3-4 to surface insights that the Likert scale could miss. These are intentionally open-ended.

- What most slows your team down today?
- Where do you feel we rely too heavily on other teams?
- What would improve your ability to deliver quality work?
- What should leadership understand better about your team?
