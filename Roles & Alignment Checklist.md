# Software Team Roles & Alignment Checklist

**Purpose:**  
Ensure team roles, responsibilities, and expectations are aligned across individuals and teams. Helps managers identify gaps, prevent misalignment, and support career growth.

---

## General Alignment Questions

For each role, ask:

1. Are responsibilities well defined and understood by the team member?
2. Are expectations for outcomes vs metrics clearly communicated?
3. Does the role align with organizational goals and OKRs/KPIs?
4. Is there clarity on decision-making authority and consensus-building responsibilities?
5. Are opportunities for learning, mentoring, and career growth provided?
