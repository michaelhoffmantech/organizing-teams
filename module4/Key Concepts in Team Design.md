# Key Concepts in Team Design

Effective team design shapes software systems, delivery flow, and organizational outcomes. The following concepts provide foundational guidance:

## Conway’s Law
- **Definition**: “Organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.” – Mel Conway, 1968
- **Implication**: The way teams are structured influences how systems are designed and evolve.
- **Application**: Design team boundaries intentionally to shape architecture and communication.

## Inverse Conway Maneuver
- **Definition**: Structuring teams intentionally to achieve a desired system architecture.
- **Goal**: Align teams with the desired flow of work, reducing silos and improving delivery speed.
- **Application**: Used to break up monoliths, create domain-aligned teams, and increase autonomy.

## Microservices
- **Definition**: Architecture pattern of small, independently deployable services.
- **Benefit**: Reduces cognitive load and cross-team handoffs; enables faster delivery.
- **Application**: Align teams with services for end-to-end ownership.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Definition**: Organize systems and teams around business domains, not technical layers.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear ownership of terms, behaviors, and data.
- **Application**: Teams aligned to domains own both business understanding and technical implementation.
