# Software Team Roles & Responsibilities Reference Sheet

**Purpose:**  
Provide a clear overview of key software team roles, their responsibilities, and best practices for alignment. Helps managers ensure expectations are set, understood, and maintained across cross-functional teams.

## 1. Core Engineering

**Primary Function:** Problem solvers who design, develop, test, and deliver features.  

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Deliver high-quality code  
  - Focus on outcomes, not arbitrary metrics  
  - Participate in Pull Request (PR) reviews actively  
- Maintain technical skills and upskill as needed  
  - Collaborate with CoPs, platform teams, or enabling teams for knowledge transfer  
- Problem-solving and decision-making  
  - Consider viable options for technical decisions  
  - Gather consensus for impactful decisions  
- Career ownership  
  - Define personal career path (technical or leadership progression)

**Best Practices for Managers:**

- Provide mentorship on testing, PR reviews, and coding standards  
- Encourage safe spaces for learning (e.g., katas)  
- Introduce AI developer tools to accelerate repetitive tasks

## 2. Platform Engineering

**Primary Function:** Enable delivery teams by providing internal platforms, automation, and reusable services.  

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Deliver high-quality platform features  
- Act as internal consultants for other teams  
- Acquire deep technical knowledge in specialization  
- Continuous learning and certification  
- Engage with teams to enable adoption of platforms and practices  

**Role Variations & Tips:**

- Split roles by specialization (e.g., cloud software vs cloud systems engineer)  
- Provide time for learning and growth; avoid full-time fire-fighting  
- Use rotations, shadowing, and lunch & learns for upskilling

## 3. Technical Lead (Tech Lead)

**Primary Function:** Balance hands-on delivery with team leadership, mentoring, and decision-making.  

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Guide engineers in design, testing, and quality practices  
- Mentor junior engineers and facilitate knowledge transfer  
- Delegate tasks strategically to balance leadership vs delivery  
- Collaborate across teams and with architects for domain-wide decisions  
- Own and shape personal career path (technical track or management)

**Best Practices for Managers:**

- Protect tech lead’s time; monitor workload using metrics and one-on-ones  
- Encourage delegation to develop other engineers  
- Provide exposure to leadership scenarios (meetings, retrospectives, interviews)

## 4. Technical Program Manager (TPM)

**Primary Function:** Drive cross-team programs, orchestrate delivery, manage risks, and align stakeholders.  

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Define program goals, scope, risks, dependencies, and OKRs/KPIs  
- Develop program roadmap and risk mitigation plans  
- Orchestrate across teams while engineering managers manage teams  
- Monitor execution, track progress, and surface data for decision-making  

**Best Practices for Managers:**

- Maintain clear communication with TPMs; surface risks and priority conflicts  
- Include tech leads and architects in planning for alignment  
- Establish cadence for regular one-on-ones and backlog reviews

## 5. Architect

**Primary Function:** Drive technical decisions, designs, and strategic direction across teams.  

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Facilitate and decide on architectural trade-offs  
- Communicate designs effectively; build shared mental models  
- Gather consensus and maintain documentation (e.g., Architecture Decision Records)  
- Contribute to code selectively (PoCs, code reviews)  
- Develop strategic roadmaps aligned with team capabilities  

**Best Practices for Managers:**

- Encourage architects to practice and refine skills via katas  
- Support embedded enablement in teams rather than “ivory tower” behavior  
- Align architecture roadmap with engineering reality  

---

## 6. Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

**Primary Function:** Ensure reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency of systems.  

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Reduce toil through automation and process improvements  
- Embed with engineering teams to understand systems and improve reliability  
- Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and error budgets  
- Respond to incidents while preventing burnout through sustainable practices  
- Provide enablement and guidance to delivery teams  

**Best Practices for Managers:**

- Treat SREs as enablers, not ticket-based responders  
- Protect time for automation vs incident response  
- Split roles by software vs systems specialization when needed  
- Use tools for monitoring and observability to accelerate effectiveness
