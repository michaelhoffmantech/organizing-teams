# Team Alignment Framework

Align teams to value streams or domains to improve delivery speed, quality, and autonomy.

## Types of Value Streams
- **Product-Based**: Responsible for a specific product end-to-end.
  - Example: Customer domain team managing CRM features.
- **User-Type**: Aligned to a persona; delivers features across multiple systems.
  - Example: Vendor portal team delivering vendor-related features.
- **Activity-Based**: Aligned to a core business activity.
  - Example: Purchasing validation across multiple systems.
- **Task-Based**: Aligned to a workflow or complex process.
  - Example: Contract review, approval, and digital signature integration.

## Domain Alignment
- **Domain Teams**: Long-lived teams owning a bounded context.
  - Responsibilities: Domain schema, business rules, APIs.
  - Can output enabling features (e.g., shared APIs for other teams).
- **Domain Stewardship Program**: Assign a team to lead a domain even without full ownership; sets a pattern for the organization.

## Support Teams
- Prefer aligning support to domains or stream-aligned teams.
- If standalone, assign to specific domain/value stream with swarm-on-demand.
- Maintain regular feedback loops to ensure alignment with delivery teams.
